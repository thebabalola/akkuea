## Features

### 1. Real Estate Tokenization

- Fractional ownership of properties through tokenization
- KYC/AML compliance on-chain
- Automated royalty distribution
- Metadata storage for property information

### 2. DeFi Lending Protocol

- Privacy-configurable lending pools
- Collateralized borrowing using tokenized real estate
- Institutional-grade privacy features
- Automated liquidation mechanisms

### 3. Key Components

- **Smart Contracts**: Soroban contracts for property tokens and lending pools
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Shared Libraries**: Common utilities, types, and Stellar integration
- **Stellar Integration**: Optimized for Stellar's fast, low-cost transactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Rust with Soroban CLI
- Stellar CLI tools

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
bun run install:all

# Start development environment
bun run dev
```

### Development

```bash
# Start webapp development server
bun run dev:webapp

# Watch contracts for changes
bun run dev:contracts

# Build all projects
bun run build

# Run tests
bun run test

# Lint and type checking
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
```

## Smart Contracts

### Real Estate Token Contract

- Property tokenization functionality
- Share ownership tracking
- Transfer and minting controls

### DeFi Lending Contract

- Pool management
- Deposit and borrowing operations
- Interest calculation and collateral management

## Architecture Highlights

- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized workspaces for better maintainability
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with shared types
- **Stellar Native**: Built specifically for Stellar's features and capabilities
- **Institutional Focus**: Privacy and compliance features for institutional adoption
- **Scalable Design**: Modular architecture for easy feature additions
- **Redis Caching Layer**: Optional Redis cache (via `REDIS_URL`) reduces database load on hot read endpoints. `GET /properties` responses are cached for 30 seconds and `GET /lending/pools` for 10 seconds, keyed by pagination and filter params. Cache is invalidated on every write operation. The app falls back to direct PostgreSQL queries when Redis is unavailable.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Smart Contracts**: Soroban (Rust)
- **Blockchain**: Stellar
- **Development**: Workspaces, ESLint, Prettier
