| Cycle Number  | 1                                                              |
| Total Issues  | 17                                                             |
| Focus Areas   | Database setup, validation, storage structures, core utilities |
| Prerequisites | None (first cycle)                                             |

## Objective

Establish the foundational infrastructure required for all subsequent development. This cycle focuses on setting up data persistence, validation layers, contract storage structures, and essential utilities that other features will depend upon.

## Parallel Workstreams

Since no issues in this cycle have dependencies on each other, all 17 issues can be worked on in parallel by different team members.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk                      | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                               |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Database schema changes   | Medium     | Medium | Design schema with extensibility in mind |
| Soroban SDK compatibility | Low        | High   | Pin SDK versions, test thoroughly        |
| Wallet integration issues | Medium     | Medium | Implement fallback mock mode             |
| Type synchronization      | Low        | Low    | Generate types from single source        |

## Notes

- This is the foundational cycle; quality and stability are prioritized over speed
- All storage structures should be designed with future upgrades in mind
- Validation schemas should be comprehensive to prevent downstream issues
- Wallet integration should gracefully handle connection failures
