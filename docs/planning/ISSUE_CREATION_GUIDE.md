## Issue Structure

Each issue in this project consists of two documentation files:

| File Type               | Purpose                                           | Audience                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `ISSUE_XXX.md`          | Professional summary with clear requirements      | Project managers, reviewers |
| `ISSUE_XXX_DETAILED.md` | Technical implementation guide with code examples | Software developers         |

### Professional File Structure

The professional file (`ISSUE_XXX.md`) must contain:

1. Issue metadata table (ID, area, difficulty, dependencies)
2. Clear description
3. Requirements list
4. Acceptance criteria
5. Estimated scope

### Detailed File Structure

The detailed file (`ISSUE_XXX_DETAILED.md`) must contain:

1. All content from professional file
2. Code examples and snippets
3. File paths and locations
4. Implementation steps
5. Testing guidelines
6. Related resources and references

## Difficulty Levels

| Level   | Description                                                                | Typical Scope        | Time Estimate     |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Trivial | Typos, small bug fixes, minor copy changes, configuration updates          | 1-20 lines of code   | Less than 2 hours |
| Medium  | Standard features, involved bug fixes, component implementations           | 20-200 lines of code | 2-8 hours         |
| High    | Complex features, major refactors, new integrations, architectural changes | 200+ lines of code   | 8+ hours          |

### Criteria for Classification

**Trivial**

- Single file changes
- No new dependencies
- No architectural impact
- Straightforward implementation path

**Medium**

- Multiple file changes within same module
- May introduce minor dependencies
- Limited architectural impact
- Clear implementation path with some complexity

**High**

- Cross-module changes
- New external dependencies or integrations
- Significant architectural considerations
- Requires design decisions and research

---

## Dependency Rules

Dependencies define the relationship between issues and determine execution order.

### Allowed Dependencies

| Scenario                                     | Allowed |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Issue in Cycle 2 depends on Issue in Cycle 1 | Yes     |
| Issue in Cycle 3 depends on Issue in Cycle 1 | Yes     |
| Issue in Cycle 3 depends on Issue in Cycle 2 | Yes     |
| Issue in Cycle 1 depends on Issue in Cycle 1 | No      |
| Issue in Cycle 2 depends on Issue in Cycle 2 | No      |

### Dependency Declaration Format

```markdown
| Dependencies | C1-003, C1-007 |
```

When an issue has no dependencies:

```markdown
| Dependencies | None |
```

### Dependency Chain Limit

- Maximum dependency chain depth: 3 cycles
- Circular dependencies are not permitted
- Each issue should minimize dependencies to enable parallel work

---

## Issue Naming Convention

### File Names

```
ISSUE_XXX.md
ISSUE_XXX_DETAILED.md
```

Where `XXX` is a zero-padded three-digit number (001, 002, ... 017).

- Show user-friendly error message when API / Soroban query returns failure
- Disable interactive elements during loading/disconnected
- Maintain visual consistency with existing [related component/page]
- Responsive layout required for mobile (≤768px) and desktop

**Suggested execution**

1. git checkout -b feature/[short-description-kebab-case]

- [ ] All interactive elements are disabled during loading/disconnected
- [ ] Error message appears for failed requests/queries
- [ ] Visual regression test passed (if applicable)
- [ ] All new strings are added to i18n files

Example commit:
`git commit -m "feat: implement staking position card with loading/error states"`
